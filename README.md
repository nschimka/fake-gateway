# README

This is the back-end API integration for the fakepay (https://www.fakepay.io/challenge) gateway. When passed customer information and credit card data, a purchase will be attempted for them that, once successful, will create a subscription and stored payment profile for them. The payment profile will reference back to the card stored at the gateway using a token.

When you send a subscription request to the API, it will return a response for that new subscription. (It won't contain the payment profile information, for no real reason other than I didn't get to it). If the subscription or payment fail, an error will be returned instead.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands from the main Fakepay directory:
```touch .env
echo FAKEPAY_KEY = put-your-key-here >> .env
```

Then run the Rails server:
```rails server```

Finally, setup and seed the database to create your products:
```rake db:setup```

You can run the test suite with this:
```bundle exec rspec spec```

Interactions with the Fakepay gateway have been pre-run and stored as VCRs.

## Attributes

These are required:

- first_name
- last_name
- product_id
- card_number (won't be stored)
- cvv
- expiration_month, as one or two digits
- expiration_year, as four digits
- zip_code

There are three product IDs you can pass; their corresponding products should already be set up in the database:

- 1 => this is for the $19.99/month Bronze Plan
- 2 => this is for the $49.00/month Silver Plan
- 3 => this is for the $99.00/month Gold Plan

These are optional, to be stored with the subscriber:

- address
- city
- state (best to pass as an ISO code but there's no enforcement of this)
- country (best to pass as an ISO code but there's no enforcement of this)

## Test Cards & Values

- 4242424242424242 is successful
- 4242424242424241 is invalid
- 4242424242420089 is lacking funds
- CVV must be 123

## Example CURLs

Once the server is running, you can send some CURL calls locally to create subscriptions and payment profiles.

### Successful Subscription & Payment Profile

```
curl "localhost:3000/subscriptions.json" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d \
  '{
    "subscription":
    {
      "first_name": "Penny",
      "last_name": "Duck",
      "address": "123 St",
      "city": "San Antonio",
      "state": "TX",
      "country": "US",
      "zip_code": "10045",
      "product_id": 3,
      "card_number": "4242424242424242",
      "cvv": "123",
      "expiration_month": "1",
      "expiration_year": "2024"
    }
  }'
```

### Calls That Will Fail

This example is missing a first and last name.
```
curl "localhost:3000/subscriptions.json" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d \
  '{
    "subscription":
    {
      "address": "123 St",
      "city": "San Antonio",
      "state": "TX",
      "country": "US",
      "zip_code": "10045",
      "product_id": 2,
      "card_number": "4242424242424242",
      "cvv": "123",
      "expiration_month": "01",
      "expiration_year": "2024"
    }
  }'
```

This example will decline due to insufficient funds.
```
curl "localhost:3000/subscriptions.json" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d \
  '{
    "subscription":
    {
      "first_name": "Penny",
      "last_name": "Duck",
      "address": "123 St",
      "city": "San Antonio",
      "state": "TX",
      "country": "US",
      "zip_code": "10045",
      "product_id": 1,
      "card_number": "4242424242420089",
      "cvv": "123",
      "expiration_month": "01",
      "expiration_year": "2024"
    }
  }'
```
